# StylusThemes
This repo is a small collection of some CSS themes I have made for websites that I use frequently. They are all still works in progress as I modify them as I have time and when I find a specific part of the style that is not being applied correctly.


## ScienceDirect

This was modified from the a StackOverflow theme I liked. Which can be found [here](https://github.com/StylishThemes/StackOverflow-Dark)

## ResearchGate

I use this website quite a bit. I was not able to find a good userstyle
